## Welcome to QT Foods.

### To run the project on local machine, run command-
```npm run dev```

## This webpage is designed with
### [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

1. For design purpose I have used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/).
2. The webpage is responsive for all devices.
3. To manage the states of food items I used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).
4. In terms of adding new foods into the list got from the api I used a form and to validate the form integrated [ReactHookForm](https://react-hook-form.com/)
5. The design is too close of the given UI design.

#### I apologize for not linking the netlify link. I have tried to host in netlify but got erros which was not solving after trying a huge amount of time. That's I have attached the run command.
